\section{Spectrum allocation vs.~usage}
\label{sec:usage}

Traditionally, the FCC has allocated spectrum bands to a single use,
issued exclusive licenses to a single entity within a geographical
area, and prohibited other devices from transmitting significant
power within these bands.  Looking at the NTIA's chart of these
frequency allocations (Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum_alloc}a), it appears
that we are in danger of running out of
spectrum~\cite{NTIAspectrum}. However, allocation is only half the
story. Contrary to popular belief, actual measurements (taken in
downtown Berkeley, CA) show that most of the allocated spectrum is
vastly underutilized
(Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum_alloc}b)~\cite{BWRC2004}.

blah blah blah...

Examining solely the 402 MHz allocated to broadcast TV
(Appendix~\ref{appen:commspec}), if we assume 70\% of the spectrum
is available, we can fit two of these systems operating
simultaneously inside the broadcast TV spectrum. The available
spectrum up to 3 GHz would fit 20 systems, blanketing an area with
20 DVD-quality video streams from low-powered wireless transmitters.

\section{The policy debate}
\label{sec:policy}

Clearly, the spectrum is far from fully utilized. As a result, the
FCC's exclusive-use allocation policy is being increasingly viewed
as outdated. Opinions on the appropriate solution, however, vary.

Some economists argue that the development of a secondary market in
spectrum would eliminate or greatly reduce the inefficiencies in
spectrum usage~\cite{Kwerel2002, Faulhaber2003}.
