% As the thesis gets bigger and bigger, you'll only want to look at a
% single chapter at a time. This is a template that prints just a single chapter
%
% Here, the COMMENT format might be particularly useful as the
% wide margins allow you or your committee to write long notes to
% yourself about how to improve things.

%%% \documentclass[11pt/12pt/10pt, final/draft/comment]{ucthesis}
%%% The first argument is the text size. The second argument changes
%%% The margins and the spacing.
%%% FINAL mode prints double spaced with figures and thesis margins.
%%% DRAFT mode prints single-spaced with 1" margins, with slightly
%%%   narrower margins for the figure captions so that they stand out.
%%% COMMENT mode prints an extra wide right margin and tiny margins
%%% everywhere else. This allows your committee plenty of room to add
%%% comments.
%%% Margins can be changed in the last lines of the ucthesis.cls
%%% with the geometry command.
