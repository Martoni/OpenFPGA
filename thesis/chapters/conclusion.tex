\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

In conclusion, we designed and implemented an Open FPGA with tool support. The design
is extensible. We verified its' functionality. The performance of the work is good
enough for real world work load. \par

\section{Future Works}
\label{sec:future_works}

The current implementation has only LUT Tiles. To have a more powerful Open FPGA, 
the MEM Tile and MUL Tile with tool support should be implemented. 
In addition to more hardware features, an enhanced tool flow that supports intermediate
step verification can help user debug the tool flow. We would also like to know how 
technology scaling going to affect the QoR of this work. \par
